## About the project

![main-menu](https://i.imgur.com/7RfxSMl.png)

This project is being created as a fun way to try using [Kludgine](https://github.com/khonsulabs/kludgine) to build a small game. In the process of looking for inspiration, [@ecton](https://github.com/ecton) stumbled across the [NEOC#03 Rhythm Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/neoc03-rhythm-jam).

The "design doc" (term used loosely) for the project can be viewed [on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1opCrOV59-S-p_wFQSyWNCMQt1MqF68cDDtcviKzLqUE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Watching Development

[@Ecton](https://github.com/ecton) will be streaming [on his channel on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ectonDev) during development, although he will also be working on the project off-stream. The primary goal is to create something for this game jam, but the secondary goal is to create a review video of using Kludgine for a game and looking at ways to improve Kludgine's design. If you're interested in the development of Kludgine, follow along on the [community forums](https://community.khonsulabs.com/), join [our Discord](https://discord.khonsulabs.com/), or follow [@ectonDev](https://twitter.com/ectonDev) on Twitter.
